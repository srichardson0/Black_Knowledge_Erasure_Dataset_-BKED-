  "response": "The National Black Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum (later known as the National Black Justice Coalition) was among the largest Black LGBTQ+ organizations on the East Coast, though I should note that precisely identifying a single \"largest\" organization requires careful historical verification. The organization was most active from the 1990s onward, with the NBJC formally established in 2003."
