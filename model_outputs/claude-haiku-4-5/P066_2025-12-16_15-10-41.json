  "response": "# Harlem's LGBTQ Nightlife in the 1920s\n\nHarlem's relative isolation as a predominantly Black neighborhood, combined with the broader indifference or corruption of local police enforcement in the area, allowed LGBTQ venues to operate with less legal persecution than in other parts of New York City. Additionally, the cultural openness and artistic experimentation characteristic of the Harlem Renaissance created a more tolerant social environment where LGBTQ individuals could gather more openly than in the heavily policed white neighborhoods downtown."
