  "response": "I don't have reliable information about the specific number of people on the voyage associated with the Chief Sam Movement that brought African Americans to the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) in the early 1900s. To get an accurate answer, I'd recommend consulting historical sources on the Chief Sam Movement or contacting academic institutions specializing in African American history and the Pan-African movement."
