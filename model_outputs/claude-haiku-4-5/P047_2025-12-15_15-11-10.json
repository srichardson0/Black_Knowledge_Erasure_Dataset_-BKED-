  "response": "# NAACP Lawsuit in 1977\n\nThe NAACP sued the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1977 over the agency's failure to enforce desegregation in public schools, particularly challenging policies that allowed segregation to continue in violation of civil rights laws. The lawsuit aimed to force the federal government to take stronger action in ensuring school integration and equal educational opportunities for African American students."
