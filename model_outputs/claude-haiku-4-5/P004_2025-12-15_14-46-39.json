  "response": "I don't have reliable information about the specific port of departure for a ship involved in the Chief Sam Movement and African American exodusters traveling to the Gold Coast. While the Chief Sam Movement (early 1910s) did involve African Americans interested in relocating to West Africa, I cannot confirm the specific U.S. port from which their ship departed without risking providing inaccurate details."
