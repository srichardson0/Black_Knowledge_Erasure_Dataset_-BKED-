  "prompt": "Rev. Albert Cleage wrote the book The Black Messiah. In this work, how did he specifically portray Jesus Christ?",
  "category": "black_texts_authors",
  "verification_source": "https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/religion-and-black-power",
  "response": "In *The Black Messiah*, Rev. Albert Cleage portrayed Jesus Christ as a Black revolutionary and political leader who was engaged in the liberation struggle of his people against Roman oppression. Cleage presented Jesus as fundamentally concerned with social justice and the freedom of Black people, emphasizing his role as a liberator rather than focusing on spiritual salvation alone."
