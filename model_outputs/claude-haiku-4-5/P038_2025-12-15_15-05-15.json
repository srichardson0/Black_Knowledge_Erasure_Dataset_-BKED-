  "response": "Sylvia Mendez protested Jim Crow policies of segregation through educational activism, though the most famous sit-in protests at department stores were conducted by other civil rights activists like the Greensboro Four in 1960. If you're asking about a specific student at St. Augustine High School, could you clarify the time period or location?"
