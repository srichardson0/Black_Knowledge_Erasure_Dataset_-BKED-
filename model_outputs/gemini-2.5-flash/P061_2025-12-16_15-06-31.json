  "category": "black_texts_authors",
  "verification_source": "https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/the-crisis",
  "response": "The most well-known poem titled \"The Present Crisis\" was written by **James Russell Lowell** and published in 1844. There isn't a prominent or widely recognized poem with that exact title from 1985; it's likely you are referring to Lowell's influential 19th-century work."
