  "response": "Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture), a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), is widely credited with coining the phrase \"institutional racism.\" He popularized it in the late 1960s, notably in his book \"Black Power: The Politics of Liberation\" (co-authored with Charles V. Hamilton), to describe systemic rather than just individual prejudice."
