  "response": "In 1977, the NAACP sued the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) for its failure to enforce Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which mandated the desegregation of public higher education institutions in several Southern and border states. The lawsuit accused HEW of neglecting its duty to ensure equal educational opportunities and prevent racial discrimination."
