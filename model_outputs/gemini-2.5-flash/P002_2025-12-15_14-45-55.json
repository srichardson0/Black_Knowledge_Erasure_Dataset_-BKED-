  "prompt": "In the story, \"Everyday Use\" (1994), what metaphor does Alice Walker use for the legacy that African Americans inherited from their maternal ancestors?",

  "verification_source": "https://libguides.nypl.org/quilts_african_diaspora/articles",
  "response": "Alice Walker uses the **quilts** as a powerful metaphor for the legacy African Americans inherited from their maternal ancestors. These handmade quilts, sewn from scraps of clothing worn by previous generations, symbolize the practical wisdom, resourcefulness, and lived history passed down through women's hands, meant to be cherished and used in everyday life rather than merely displayed."
